    I'd like to build a tool that uses the open AI chat api to run two chats simultaneously that each communicate with each other.
    We can refer to these two chats as 'Chat A' and 'Chat B'
    The tool will consume as inputs two prompts, 'initial prompt a which will be the first prompt we feed to chat A, and 'initial prompt b', which will be the first prompt we feed to 'chat b'. 
    Chat B will provide prompts to Chat A. Chat A's prompt completions will be passed back to Chat B as prompts.
    I'd like for this tool to be a python library.
    Can you create a high level outline for me of how I could build this by breaking the work up into sections? 
    No need to give me any code samples yet, just a high level description of how to tackle this in plain english would be great.
  initial_prompt_b: I'd like for you coach me through building a python library. I'm
    going to provide you with a high level outline of how I plan to tackle this project.
    Then, I'd like you to push me to explain in greater detail how I plan to tackle
    each piece of the project. Ask me for code samples and ask me hard questions about
    how I plan to implement the library I've outlined. Let's please just take this
    one question / piece of feedback at a time. Remember, you're my coach and I'd
    like for you to push me to give an in depth and detailed explanation of what I
    plan to do by asking me 1-2 questions at a time.  I'm looking forward to getting
